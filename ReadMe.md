Here’s a README file you can use for GitHub, detailing what the code does and providing some additional context.

Password Strength Assessment Tool

Overview

This tool is a C-based program that evaluates the strength of a password based on various security criteria. It assesses each password entered by the user and provides suggestions to improve its strength until a “Strong” or “Very Strong” password is created.

How It Works

The program checks the password against several criteria:

	•	Length: Checks if the password has at least 12 characters.
	•	Character Types: Evaluates the presence of:
	•	Uppercase letters
	•	Lowercase letters
	•	Numbers
	•	Special characters (e.g., @$!%*?&)

Score Calculation

The password’s score is determined by the following:

	1.	Length: Adds 2 points if the password is at least 12 characters long.
	2.	Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters:
	•	Each type (uppercase, lowercase, number) adds 1 point.
	•	Special characters contribute an additional 2 points.

Based on the final score:

	•	Score 2 or below: Password strength is “Weak”.
	•	Score 3–4: Password strength is “Moderate”.
	•	Score 5–6: Password strength is “Strong”.
	•	Score 7+: Password strength is “Very Strong”.

If the password is rated below “Strong,” the program suggests improvements, such as adding more characters, including uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters.

Program Flow

	1.	User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a password.
	2.	Strength Assessment: It calculates the password’s score based on length and character types.
	3.	Feedback: If the password is rated below “Strong,” the program provides feedback and suggestions to improve it.
	4.	Loop Until Strong Password: The process repeats until a “Strong” or “Very Strong” password is provided.

Sample Output

Enter a password to assess: pass123
Password Strength: Weak
Suggestions to improve your password:
- Increase the length to at least 12 characters.
- Add at least one uppercase letter.
- Use at least one special character (e.g., @$!%*?&).

Enter a password to assess: Passw0rd!@#
Password Strength: Very Strong
Great! You have entered a strong password.

Code Structure

	•	test_pswrd_str(): A function that evaluates the password’s length and checks for character types, returning a score.
	•	main(): Continuously prompts the user to enter a password until a strong one is provided.

With this tool, users can ensure their passwords meet basic security requirements, which strengthens their protection against unauthorized access.
